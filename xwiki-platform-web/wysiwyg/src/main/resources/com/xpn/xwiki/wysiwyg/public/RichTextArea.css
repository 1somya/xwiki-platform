  XWiki 2.0 renderer places the contents of a header inside a span, which is styled in the skin. Since this is not
  common to all the syntaxes and the CSS rules can be applied directly to the header, the editor doesn't generate this
  span when applying header style to the selection. In order to view headers as in view mode we have to block some of
  the CSS rules applied to the span and add then to the header.
