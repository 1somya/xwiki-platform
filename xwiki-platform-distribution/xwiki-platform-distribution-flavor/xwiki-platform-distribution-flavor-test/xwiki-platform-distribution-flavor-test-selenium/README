This module is being phased out using this strategy:

* New UI tests should be written using Selenium2 and go in ui-tests/
* Slowly migrate existing functional tests in this module to ui-tests/ over time
* Use the PageObject pattern in new tests in ui-tests/ (http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects)
