  <!-- As we're currently in a code style migration we are turning off some checks here. The goal
       is to reduce this list so that all checks are on . For example to exclude all checks for
       all Java classes, except the Leftcurly check, you would write:

       <suppress checks="(!?LeftCurly)" files=".*\.java"/>

       To exclude all checks for all classes except for the Api.java class you would write:

       <suppress checks=".*" files="(!?Api.java)"/>
  -->
  <suppress checks=".*" files=".*"/>
</suppressions>
