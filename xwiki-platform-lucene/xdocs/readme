XWiki Lucene Plugin by Jens Kr√§mer (jk@jkraemer.net), Version 0.9

This plugin allows index based search in the contents of Wiki Pages and
their attachments, as far as any text can be extracted from them.
At the moment text can be extracted from OpenOffice Writer, MSWord, PDF, XML/XHTML
and, of course Plain text documents. text extraction is done with the help of various
third party libs such as Apache POI and PDFBox and some classes from the Daisy project.

For installation instructions see the file install.
