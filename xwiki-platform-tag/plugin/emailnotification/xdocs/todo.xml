			<ul>
				<li>
					correct To: header, at the moment there is none at all. Have to look into how to 
          correctly use XWiki's mail functions.
				</li>
				<li>
					more per user preferences, i.e. choose between different types of notifications 
          (diffs, full content of changed pages, list of changed pages only). Maybe let 
          each user define his own velocity template for his notification mails ?
				</li>
				<li>
					Internationalize notification mail template. This could be done by using message 
					keys inside the template or by making the template a wiki page having translations 
					for the supported languages.
				</li>
				<li>
					Check performance for large user numbers and/or high change frequency. The algorithm 
					used to compile the list of notifications to send to each user is somewhat simple,
					there is room for improvement for sure.
				</li>
        <li>
          The plugin should work in virtual wiki installations, but sonce I don't 
          have such a setup, it's completely untested.
