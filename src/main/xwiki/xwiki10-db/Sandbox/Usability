<content>1 Usability

1.1 Main Menu: Selecting from popup menus is almost impossible
When hovering over the "Edit" in the main menu a popup menu appears. As soon as you move the mouse towards an entry in the popup menu the popup menu disappears. Was able to reproduce this in Firefox and Safari.
* Fixed (rollback)

1.1 Visual Editor: back button causes all changes to be lost
When using the visual editor and you hit the back button in your browser, all the changes get lost.
More normal behavior:
* User is asked whether she wants to save her changes
* Back button is disabled when using the visual editor
* Changes are ALWAYS saved when going away from a page
* Back button causes undo when using the visual editor - can also be confusing

1.1 Catching Exceptions
* Common exceptions should be handled in a more intelligent way than by printing a big, ugly, scary stack-trace to the user.
* For example, let's say I started XWiki but the database is not accessible. What I get now is this (+huge stack-trace):

~~javax.servlet.ServletException: Error number 3 in 0: Could not initialize main XWiki context

Wrapped Exception: Error number 3202 in 3: Exception while reading document XWiki.XWikiPreferences

Wrapped Exception: Could not create a DBCP pool~~

* A better error message would be "Cannot connect to the database", with a small "details" link that allows an expert user to get to the stack-trace.

1.1 Editor: Save and continue editing

1.1 Watch: Does not work yet

1.1 Wiki Editor: Duplication
* There is a Title edit on top of the window
* There is a smaller one in "XWiki document information" (with a useless "set" button that is not even in the right place - [Screenshot&gt;http://static.zooomr.com/images/e8d50d5ea0d6693fc6d28eee6cec511c02f78cb0.jpg])

1.1 Edit Objects: Vertical layout broken
* If the tabs are very different in height - maximum is taken which might be huge
* Screenshots: [Safari&gt;http://beta.zooomr.com/_/zooom_it.awe?id=144913&amp;size=32] [Firefox&gt;http://beta.zooomr.com/_/zooom_it.awe?id=144914&amp;size=32]

1.1 Edit Objects: Panel Layout broken in Safari
* In this case caused by two Size 60 number fields (XWiki.XWikiUsers: Blog and Blog Feed)
* [Screenshot&gt;http://static.zooomr.com/images/1cd9799c7b1fe58039d7b21de2f70ff2220c175a.jpg]

1.1 Add Object: Useless button
* The button "Add object from this class" is useless and makes interaction slower ... it should be enough to select a class in the combo-box and ... puff you have inserted an object of that class
* The combo-box could be named "... of this class" ... so that all the information is still there

1.1 Edit Objects: Bogus ending for the object names
* Just get rid of them, they are highly confusing
{pre}XWiki.XWikiRights[0]: *Allow*{/pre}

{pre}XWiki.XWikiRights[1]: *Allow*{/pre}

{pre}XWiki.XWikiUsers[0]: *Yes*{/pre}

{pre}XWiki.hritcu[0]: *24*{/pre}

1.1 Edit Classes: Missing Titles
* First a big title saying "Editing class ClassName"
* Then a smaller one saying "Fields:" ... or make every field tab to have the name: "Field: someField" ... then I will know I am editing fields there

1.1 Edit Classes: Welcome to hell
* "Welcome!" panel bad in about every possible way
* Not good name ... "Help" would be OK ... but then it should only give help ... not also host functionality
* "You are editing XWiki....": this could be a title ... on top of the fields
* "Choose a field to edit" ... well ... at least indicate some way that those in the left are fields
* "...or add a *field* to the class." ... how? by using the *Add Property* panel of course (see next point ... inconsistency)
* The combo-box "Edit another class" is too small to accommodate the text. What I see is "- -Edit another clas" in safari ([Screenshot&gt;http://beta.zooomr.com/_/zooom_it.awe?id=144946&amp;size=32]) and "Edit another cl" in Firefox ([Screenshot&gt;http://static.zooomr.com/images/7e5a4bb4f2c7cfa445ffd63362811c3867aeba68.jpg]) ... this could be on a separate panel entitled "Select class"
* The button "Change class" is useless and makes interaction slower ... it should be enough to select a new class in the combo-box and ... puff you are editing the class

1.1 Edit Classes: Inconsistency
* You either call them *fields* or *properties* - not both

1.1 Add Property: Useless Repetition
* In the "Add Property" panel the two fields could be named "Name" and "Type" ... no need to repeat "property" everywhere

1.1 Edit Classes: Preview useless
* Can the embedded classes change the layout of a document?

1.1 Edit: Inline Form Indistinguishable from View
* When there is no form to edit, other than the three buttons at the bottom of the page, the edit inline form looks exactly like the view action.
* It should be easy to distinguish visually between the two.

1.1 Page Access Rights: Name too long
* Just "Access Rights" would be enough ... you can latter give more hints like adding a "Document Access Rights" title or adding a tooltip

* The menu is huge anyway ([Screenshot small window&gt;http://static.zooomr.com/images/105cb9ee3fa83ccd62d4e79fc5e85a94fd636ebc.jpg])

1.1 Page Access Rights: User or/xor Group?
* Selecting a user and selecting a group to give permissions are exclusive?
* If yes then make the interface explicit about this
* If you can select both, but still one would suffice (inclusive or) then make this explicit somehow

1.1 Page Access Rights: Rights editor help very verbose but not that helpful

1.1 Page Access Rights: Rights editor help - scroll problems (Safari)
* Why are scroll-bars disabled when they are needed?
* There is no easy was to scroll other than using the wheel of my mouse
* [Screenshot&gt;http://static.zooomr.com/images/a91bb2b7eec66e3c4006b60681d75ddacd14c10b.jpg]

1.1 Page Access Rights: Rights editor help - cannot open any tabs (Firefox)
* Probably related to the previous bug
* [Screenshot&gt;http://static.zooomr.com/images/1d5a6b882ba90c99a1b8bb1e1a753995bf8499ce.jpg]

1.1 Preview: Inconsistency
* Cancel | Back To Edit | Save
* The edit page has buttons like this ... the preview page just plain links

1.1 Change Profile: Inconsistency
* The link to "Change your foto" leads to a page called "Change avatar"
* I think calling it "avatar" is a little too much ... this is not an online game, or a time-wasting messaging app
* "Upload new avatar file" is quite strange ... what should I upload? ... a 3ds scene? a .avatar file?

1.1 Bad titles for pages -&gt; Bad bookmarks
* The title of a page should also include the action being performed - "editing access rights for PageX" instead of just "PageX"

1.1 Edit classes: Double negation is evil
* Unmodifiable: No -&gt; Modifiable: Yes

1.1 Login: Way too verbose and confusing
* Way too much fuss for a simple feature like remembering the password: "This is a public/shared computer, do not remember me"/"This is a private computer, please remember me"
* Just put a checkbox saying just "Remember me"
* You can give more details in a tooltip
* Don't assume so much about the way a user manages it's passwords ... there are many people who don't want passwords stored even on their private computer.

1.1 Footer: Style Problem in Safari
* The lowest line in the footer on every page appears much shorter than it should be ([Screenshot&gt;http://static.zooomr.com/images/d3bce5e9c17adb036aa871d73cdfec5540f61501.jpg])

1.1 Changing the Language
* It should be easy to change the language of the interface an the language of the documents you view and edit
* You should also be able to see which language your documents are in ... and change between languages (this can be done while editing now ... what about when viewing?)

1.1 XWiki Syntax Help: Collapsed by default
* Why is the XWiki Syntax Help collapsed by default (i always use it), while the translations always open (i never use it)?

1.1 Typos
* What does "toget" mean in the "XWiki syntax help"? "To get" ? Expected result? Result?
* When deleting a comment the user is asked whether she is "shure" about that.
