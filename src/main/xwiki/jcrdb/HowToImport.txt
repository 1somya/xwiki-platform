How to import data to XWikiJcrStore:

Start empty XWiki at JCR (by uncomment jcr configuration in xwiki.cfg)
Create document XWiki.Import (any name) and copy to it content of file ./XWiki.Import.
Change path to db (fromdir), is needed.
Save.
Click 'force'.
Enjoy.

I try to use the xwiki-tools/backup/ scripts on jcr. But it produce wrong
data.
